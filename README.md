# calculator
### project 5 and the culminating project from the odin project's fundamentals course
calculator is a basic four-function calculator that does not consider order of operations. user can string together multiple operations but the result is displayed each step of the way. for instance, '2+5x3-' would return '10' upon pressing 'x' and then '30' upon pressing '-'. calculator also includes buttons for positive/negative, a decimal, a percent conversion, a backspace, and all-clear. 

KNOWN ISSUES
1. buggy if an operator is chosen at the very beginning. need to check if this action occured in previous versions because i believe i tested against this.
2. lacks keystroke functionality.
